# Code for: Photon Sphere Structure in Hayward Regular Black Holes  


## Files  
- `photon_sphere.py`: Solves Eq. (13) using Brent's method (Python 3.10)  
- `verification.nb`: Independent verification via Newton-Raphson (Mathematica)  

## Usage  
1. Run `photon_sphere.py` to generate photon sphere radii (Table 1, Figs 1-4)  
2. Open `verification.nb` to cross-check selected values
